# Eighty20 Technical Challenge

Hello reviewer, I hope you are well!

This is the repo that contains all the source for the technical challenge that I was tasked to produce for the Fullstack position at Eighty20. This repo is somewhat a monorepo as it contains both the backend and frontend source code.

The setup instructions are found in both the `/backend` and `/fronted` folder. You can navigate to those folders and you read the `README` files to understand what you need to do to start the setup or reviewal process.

If there is anything that you need from me you can just reach out to me!

Also, please go through this document first before reviewing the project itself: [Eighty20 Technical Challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vSQyXSkByph2dHdPPf-uPG0PS-_3UgFaUai4y9_R3xo/edit?usp=sharing)
